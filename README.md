 ## ðŸš€ Deploying Your Gatsby Website to GitHub Pages

To deploy your Gatsby website to GitHub Pages, follow these steps:

1. **Build Your Site:**
   First, ensure your site is built and ready for deployment. Run the following command in your terminal:

   ```shell
   npm run build
   ```
  This will build the local directory and push those changes to a branch called gh-pages.
