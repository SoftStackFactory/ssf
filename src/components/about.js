        SoftStack Factory (SSF) expanded to establish SSF Labs, an initiative led by CEO Harold Gottschalk and CTO Scott Holcombe. SSF 
        Labs was designed to support local tech companies by integrating recent graduates into project teams, where they could contribute 
        to real-world projects under the guidance of experienced industry leaders. This provided graduates with valuable hands-on experience 
        and full-time employment while offering companies the unique advantage of local, highly-skilled teams led by former CTOs of public 
        companies—ensuring both quality and affordability.

        Throughout the initiative, SSF Labs partnered with multiple companies on a range of projects, and companies were given the option 
        to retain team members for full-time roles—a transition that occurred on numerous occasions, reinforcing the program’s success and 
        impact. This model proved mutually beneficial, cultivating workforce readiness while enabling businesses to access skilled talent 
        seamlessly.
